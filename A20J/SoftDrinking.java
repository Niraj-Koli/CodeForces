/*
 * This winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group of n friends decided to buy k
 * bottles of a soft drink called "Take-It-Light" to warm up a bit. Each bottle
 * has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them
 * into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.
 * 
 * To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of
 * lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they
 * can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend
 * make?
 * 
 * Input
 * The first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np,
 * not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly
 * one space.
 * 
 * Output
 * Print a single integer â€” the number of toasts each friend can make.
